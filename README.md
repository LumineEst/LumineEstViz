# Factory Flow to Fortune: Mixed-Model Assembly Line Simulation

A browser-based simulation designed to model, optimize, and analyze a mixed-model refrigerator assembly line. Unlike static calculators, this application integrates factory physics, capacity planning, financial forecasting, and geospatial logistics optimization into a single interactive dashboard.  It is both a powerful educational and decision-making tool for how to design a mixed-model assembly line.

## 📖 Overview

**Factory Flow to Fortune** challenges users to design an assembly line for three distinct refrigerator models (Super, Ultra, Mega) with a fixed production ratio (35%/45%/20%). The objective is to maximize profitablity while navigating strictly enforced engineering constraints.

The system simulates the friction of real-world manufacturing:
* **Task-Times:** Assembly is based on 31 atomic elements with defined task-times, and order constraints.
* **Quality:** Yield is not a static input but a dynamic outcome of worker stress, conveyor speed, and wage competitiveness.
* **Logistics:** Shipping costs fluctuate based on the Producer Price Index (PPI) and real-world geography.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. Operational Balancing (Efficiency Tab)
* **Visual Line Balancing:** Interactive drag-and-drop interface to assign tasks across 3–13 workstations.
* **Real-Time Metrics:** Instantly calculates Cycle Time, Balance Delay, and Idle Time CV (Coefficient of Variation) to diagnose line health.
* **Bottleneck Detection:** Visualizes workstation utilization to identify capacity constraints.
  
*Note:* Idle-Time will always exist due to delays between the start/end of production, and when a model reaches the workstation. 

### 2. Physical Simulation (Layout & Schedule Tabs)
* **U-Shaped Layout:** An animated SVG visualization of product flow, demonstrating the physical movement of units and identifying spacing issues.
* **Build Sequencing:** The optimal build sequence to smooth labor between variations in models, tracking accumulation of WIP (Work-In-Progress).
* **Gantt Scheduling:** A discrete-event timeline tracks every unit's start and end time, visualizing cascading delays caused by variability.

*Note:* Advanced Controls for Schedule can be shown by clicking the ! button on the bottom right. 

### 3. Financial & Investment Analysis (Profit & Investment Tabs)
* **Profit Maximization:** Performs a search across demand levels (50–552 units) to find the optimal configuration (Headcount & Operational Hours).
* **CapEx Modeling:** Calculates NPV, IRR, and Payback Period using MACRS depreciation schedules for both new and expanding assembly lines.
* **Probabilistic Forecasting:** Uses P10/P50/P90 demand scenarios to assess investment risk under uncertainty.

*Note:* Working Days per Year are allocated with a Calendar which can be accessed in the menu, impacting the Annual Demand levels. 

### 4. Logistics Optimization (Location Tab)
* **Facility Location:** Solves for the optimal US geographic location to minimize freight costs based on customer demand clusters.
* **Inventory Simulation:** Runs a daily inventory simulation to balance holding costs against shipping frequency.
* **Annual Production Schedule:** Finds an optimal build schedule which meets customer demands while minimizing operational costs.

*Note:* Inventory Simulations can be accessed with a popup ribbon on the bottom. 

## 🧮 Algorithms & Mathematical Models

This project implements several advanced industrial engineering algorithms to drive the simulation:

### Production & Sequencing
* **BIRW (Backpropagating Iterative Ranked Weights):** A custom line-balancing algorithm. It performs a forward propagation using Ranked Positional Weights to establish a baseline, then iteratively back-propagates using standard deviation ratios to find the task assignment with the lowest idle time variance.
* **MSSA (Model-Mix Sequencing Algorithm):** Implements Heijunka (production leveling) logic. It calculates an interval `w` for each model and uses an accumulator `a` to sequence production (e.g., A-B-A-C), ensuring smooth demand on upstream components.

### Optimization & Logistics
* **Weiszfeld Algorithm:** Used in the "Greenfield" location analysis to iteratively solve the **Weber Problem**, finding the geometric median that minimizes weighted distances to all distribution hubs.
* **MILP (Mixed Integer Linear Programming):** Utilizes the `highs.js` solver to optimize the shipment start-day schedule, minimizing peak daily loads subject to frequency constraints.
* **Non-Linear LTL Costing:** Calculates Less-Than-Truckload (LTL) shipping rates using a density-based formula derived from the Producer Price Index (PPI) and shipment weight/distance.

### Quality & Stress Modeling
First Pass Yield (FPY) is calculated by subtracting penalties from four distinct stress vectors:
1.  **Process Stress:** Probability of task overruns calculated using CV and available slack time between models based on MSSA Bayesian probabilities.
2.  **Conveyor Stress:** Penalizes yield as conveyor speed approaches human reaction limits (derated by task variability).
3.  **Wage Stress:** Compares the user-set labor rate against the **Median Household Income** of the facility's specific census block (via API) to model workforce quality.
4.  **Fatigue (Sigmoid):** Applies a logistic function to penalize quality drastically once overtime exceeds a specific "burnout" threshold (~20%).

## 🏗 Technical Architecture

Built as a high-performance Single Page Application (SPA) utilizing modern browser capabilities:

* **Visualization:** **D3.js (v7)** handles all data-driven SVG rendering (Gantt charts, Maps, Gauges).
* **Web Workers:** Heavy computational tasks (MILP solver, Inventory Simulation) run on background threads (`simulation.worker.js`) to ensure UI responsiveness.
* **WebAssembly (WASM):** Integrates the **HiGHS** optimization solver via WASM for near-native performance on linear programming tasks.
* **Geography:** **TopoJSON** renders the US map for the location analysis.
