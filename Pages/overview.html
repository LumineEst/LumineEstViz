<h2>Factory Flow to Fortune - Mastering the Mixed-Model Assembly Line</h2>
<section class="overview-section overview-intro">
    <p class="overview-desc">
        You have been tasked with designing a new mixed-assembly line to take on a new contract for
        a product line of refrigerators. How many people will you need to hire? What conveyor supplies do you need to
        purchase? How many Refrigerators should you aim to build each day? Can you meet the contracted Demand? How much
        do you need to charge for each Model?
    </p>
    <h2><strong>Where Do You Even Start?</strong></h2>

    <h3>The Problem Space & Constraints</h3>
    <p>The simulation is built on a defined scenario with foundational rules that cannot be altered:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Product Mix</strong> – A fixed production ratio of three refrigerator models: 35% Super, 45% Ultra,
            and 20% Mega. Each has a different financial profile and different required tasks.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Work Elements</strong> – 31 indivisible assembly tasks, each with a specific labor and machine time
            requirement. They form a constraint in how well you can balance tasks between employees.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Precedence Constraints</strong> – The strict, non-negotiable sequence in which tasks must be
            performed. Violating these rules results in an invalid, impossible, or low-quality production.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Workstations</strong> – A series of 3 to 13 stations, operated by one employee each, to which all
            work elements must be assigned. Due to the Work Elements, more than 13 stations cannot meet a higher demand.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Factory Physics</strong> – The system is governed by a fixed assembly line length of 486 feet, which
            directly impacts throughput calculations. This is based on ensuring the smallest elements have enough space.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Shipping Cube-Out</strong> – Due to having a fixed Build Ratio, shipments are assumed to also follow
            this ratio of models, with the volume of all shipments being based on a 53' trailer which is loaded with an
            assumed density and packing cube-out distribution which is shown in Backend Mechanics below.
        </li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section class="overview-section">
    <h3>Core Operational and Financial Inputs</h3>
    <p>These are the variables you can adjust to define your production and test different strategies:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Workstations:</strong> The number of employees on the line, which determines how the work
            elements can be distributed.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Task Assignment:</strong> Drag and drop elements between workstations (in the left sidebar) to
            change Balance and Cycle Time. This is the primary way you will manually balance your assembly line.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Daily Demand:</strong> The number of units you must produce per day, which influences Takt Time.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Operating Hours:</strong> The available production time for a shift. Driving labor costs and
            Takt Time.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Financial Inputs:</strong> Key cost and price parameters, including labor rate, material costs, and
            selling price for each model.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Quality Yield:</strong> The percentage of built products which are built correctly, influenced by many
            employee stresses.  This directly impacts
            <strong data-tooltip="Cost of Poor Quality. Calculated from Operational conditions between Workstations, Factory Location, Rework and Labor Costs, and Build Schedule.">
                CoPQ
            </strong>, based on the average cost of rework by model.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Investment Factors:</strong> Many other variables must be accounted for to determine the long-term
            value of the assembly line, these are self-contained within the Investment and Location tabs.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Location and Shipping:</strong> The choice of where to place the factory in order to meet a specific shipping schedule.
            This involves balancing many variables across all tabs, in order to select a schedule and location which maximizes profit while meeting distribution demand.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Understanding the Tabs</h3>
    <p>
        Each tab provides a unique lens for analyzing your line, moving from physical behaviors to financial outcomes.
        Tooltips are used to help clarify terminologies. The three different color groups build on each other, with a growing complexity from left to right.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; – <strong style="color: #eba21b; text-shadow: -0.5px -0.5px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3), 0.5px -0.5px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3), -0.5px 0.5px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3), 0.5px 0.5px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);">Yellow</strong> tabs clarify core immutable aspects of the assembly process.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; – <strong style="color: #009688; text-shadow: -0.5px -0.5px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3), 0.5px -0.5px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3), -0.5px 0.5px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3), 0.5px 0.5px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);">Green</strong> tabs explore operational behaviors of the assembly line.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; – <strong style="color: #7E57C2; text-shadow: -0.5px -0.5px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3), 0.5px -0.5px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3), -0.5px 0.5px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3), 0.5px 0.5px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);">Purple</strong> tabs explore financial factors and outcomes of the assembly line.<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong style="color: #eba21b; text-shadow: -0.5px -0.5px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3), 0.5px -0.5px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3), -0.5px 0.5px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3), 0.5px 0.5px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);">Precedence</strong> – Visualizes the "hard logic" of the assembly process. This network diagram
            shows which tasks must be completed before others can begin. Violating this logic will be flagged, as it
            creates a physically impossible sequence which leads to poor quality.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong style="color: #009688; text-shadow: -0.5px -0.5px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3), 0.5px -0.5px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3), -0.5px 0.5px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3), 0.5px 0.5px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);">Schedule</strong> – A dynamic Gantt chart that visualizes the production plan over time. It tracks
            the progress of each unit through every task, showing the cascading consequences of delays at the bottleneck
            station. It provides a visual way to understand when employees will have work within their station.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong style="color: #009688; text-shadow: -0.5px -0.5px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3), 0.5px -0.5px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3), -0.5px 0.5px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3), 0.5px 0.5px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);">Efficiency</strong> – The primary dashboard for your line's performance. It provides a
            workstation-by-workstation breakdown of productive time vs. idle time, highlighting the bottleneck and
            quantifying the overall Balance Loss.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong style="color: #009688; text-shadow: -0.5px -0.5px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3), 0.5px -0.5px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3), -0.5px 0.5px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3), 0.5px 0.5px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);">Layout</strong> – Simulates the physical U-shaped factory floor. This view animates product flow,
            allowing you to visually identify where bottlenecks and idleness occurs in your current
            configuration. It also visualizes how space is used, WIP, and the ideal build sequence of models.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong style="color: #7E57C2; text-shadow: -0.5px -0.5px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3), 0.5px -0.5px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3), -0.5px 0.5px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3), 0.5px 0.5px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);">Profit</strong> – Translates operational efficiency into financial results. This tab uses your
            line's throughput to calculate the Daily Gross Profit and Gross Profit Margin, directly connecting your
            design choices to the bottom line. It allows you to evaluate product pricing and material costs.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong style="color: #7E57C2; text-shadow: -0.5px -0.5px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3), 0.5px -0.5px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3), -0.5px 0.5px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3), 0.5px 0.5px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);">Location</strong> – A logistics and location planning tool to determine the optimal location in the
            United States to minimize shipping costs between the new Factory and Existing Distribution Hubs. Optimize
            your Shipment allocations to balance meeting Demands and minimizing Inventory Holding Costs.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong style="color: #7E57C2; text-shadow: -0.5px -0.5px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3), 0.5px -0.5px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3), -0.5px 0.5px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3), 0.5px 0.5px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);">Investment</strong> – A strategic planning tool for long-term analysis. It evaluates the financial
            viability of your current line (Base Case) or a re-optimized one (Expansion Case) against uncertain future
            demand using P10, P50, and P90 forecasts and standard financial metrics like NPV and IRR.

    <h3>Key Principles & Terms</h3>
    <p>
        These core manufacturing metrics are calculated in real-time to diagnose the health of your assembly line
        design:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong data-tooltip="The required pace of production to meet customer demand. Calculated from Daily Demand and Operating Hours.">
                Takt
                Time
            </strong> – The "heartbeat" of the factory. It's the pace your line *must* maintain to meet
            customer demand, calculated from your Daily Demand and Operating Hours.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong data-tooltip="The actual time it takes for one unit to be completed at the slowest workstation. This determines your line's true output.">
                Cycle
                Time
            </strong> – The actual speed of your line, determining your total Throughput. It is
            determined by the total labor time of the slowest workstation, which is the line's <strong data-tooltip="The single process or workstation that limits the overall output of the entire system.">bottleneck</strong>.
            To meet
            demand, your Cycle Time must be less than or equal to Takt Time.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong data-tooltip="Unproductive time within a workstation where an operator is waiting for the next unit because their assigned tasks are finished.">
                Idle
                Time
            </strong> – Unproductive time within a workstation's cycle. It represents paid time where
            an operator is waiting for the next unit because their assigned tasks are completed faster than the
            bottleneck station. This directly reduces the profitability of your line.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong data-tooltip="A percentage that quantifies the total inefficiency from an unequal workload distribution across all workstations.">
                Balance
                Loss
            </strong> – A percentage that quantifies the total inefficiency of the line. It
            aggregates the idle time across all workstations, measuring the waste from an imperfect workload balance. A
            lower score is better. Poor Balance causes Idle time and employee dissatistfaction
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Gross Profit</strong> – This is the profit that your products generate before factory expenses are
            considered, calculated as "Sales" - "Labor" - "Materials". For your factory to succeed, you must generate
            enough profit to cover your other expenses.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Element vs Labor Time</strong> – In a mixed assembly line, where different models have different
            tasks required, the Element time a task takes to complete will impact how much conveyor space it needs;
            however, the balancing of tasks should use the average labor time throughout the day.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Conveyor Layout</strong> – To minimize wasted movement from employees in the workstations between
            the beginning and end of their workstations, as well as to improve communication within the team, the use of
            U-Shaped workstations is preferrable in laying out the assembly line's configuration.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>WIP & Held Inventory</strong> – Holding Inventory in your factory ties up capital which could be
            better invested, carries administrative costs like taxes and insurance, requires excess storage and
            handling, as well as deterioration, shrinkage, and obsolescence risks.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>CoPQ & SRR</strong> – The Cost of Poor Quality is influenced by SRR (Scrap, Rework, Repair) of units
            which were built incorrectly.  This is caused by overworkage, insufficient buffer time to cope with variance,
            and non-competitive wages.
        </li>
    </ul>
